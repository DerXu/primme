Four drivers, one for each model:

    I. driverI.m 	the model in the RSVDpack
   II. driverII.m	the model from genomics
  III. driverIII.m 	the Laplacian model 
   IV. driverIV.m 	the model from the FD paper

    G. driverG.m 	we may need a general driver for sparse matrices
  
Each driver runs all methods (SVDS, PRIMME, RSVD, FD)
for whatever sizes are approrpiate for the model.


Issue: I am not sure PRIMME will win any of these comparisons in the "default" mode.
We may need to increase maxBlockSize. The question is to what? Perhaps we can experiment with maxBockSize = [1, 10, numEvals].
